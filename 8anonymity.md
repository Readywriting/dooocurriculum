## Activity
Create an alternate persona on the web and then express yourself via that persona as well as via your primary digital idenity. Compare and contrast your observations. 

OR

Create an account that is the complete opposite of you, and try to play that role. Document your experience. 

## Questions

1. Have you ever created a persona where you have not explicity said who you are? If so, then why?
2. What have your experiences been with anonymity online? Have you had positive, negative, and/or netural encounters and interactions?
3. What are some the ways that you could remain anonymous on the web? 
4. Is anonymity broken?

## Instructor Guide
It is very important to talk your students about the issues before students experiment with the activities because mis-represenation and anonymity can potentially be dangerous as trolling can be hurtful and hateful.In addition, remind students who may be role playing that they can potentially create real relationships with people. There are real people on the other end, and even if you are being benevolent, ultimately, you are betraying someone's trust. Lastly, your students may already have very strong opions about anynomity, both positive and negative (i.e. experiences on Yik Yak, receiving hateful comments on Twitter, or how in the past, LGBTQ individuals found a safe space anyonymous chat rooms to inhabit their identiy).

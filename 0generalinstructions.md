# General Instructions
 
Instructors are encouraged to assign readings/videos at the beginning of the unit time frame (1-2 weeks is recommended). Students should also receive the assignment for the week at this time (in-class time can be devoted this, but it can also be completed outside of class hours). 
 
By the end of the time frame, once the readings and activity are completed, there should be either a face-to-face or online discussion (in blog, Canvas, Slack, etc.) among students about the topic. The questions can be used to guide this discussion. If occurring online, students should be required to read and respond to each other’s ideas. 
 
Instructors are invited to add/remove questions and readings, as well as to change the ordering, and to tie the module topic to class topics as appropriate!
